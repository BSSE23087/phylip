Estimates phylogenies from gene frequency data by maximum
   likelihood under a model in which all divergence is due to genetic drift in
   the absence of new mutations.  Does not assume a molecular clock.  An
   alternative method of analyzing this data is to compute Nei's genetic
   distance and use one of the distance matrix programs.
   This program can also do maximum likelihood analysis of continuous
   characters that evolve by a Brownian Motion model, but it assumes that
   the characters evolve at equal rates and in an uncorrelated fashion, so
   that it does not take into account the usual correlations of characters.


<P> <IMG SRC="icons/CONTRAST.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CONTRAST</STRONG>.
Reads a tree from a tree file, and a data set with continuous
   characters data, and produces the independent contrasts for those
   characters, for use in any multivariate statistics package.  Will also
   produce covariances, regressions and correlations between characters for
   those contrasts.  Can also correct for within-species sampling variation
   when individual phenotypes are available within a population.
