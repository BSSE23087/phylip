The already-compiled executables available are
<UL>
<LI><STRONG> 64-bit Windows executables</STRONG>
<LI><STRONG>older 32-bit Windows executables</STRONG>, which are 32 bit executables
of PHYLIP 3.695 that will work on Windows95, Windows98, Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows me,
Windows xp, Windows Vista, and Windows 10 on 32-bit systems.
<LI><STRONG>Macintosh Mac OS X executables</STRONG> for PowerMac and
Intel Mac OS X systems.  We distribute "universal binaries" that work
on both platforms (basically they are a pair of binaries set up so that
the appropriate one will run).
These use the native Mac OS X Aqua windowing system for the character-based
menus and for the graphics windows for the tree-drawing programs.  The programs
are activated by clicking on their icons.  Links are also provided in the same
folder that enable the programs to be run by typing their names.
<LI><STRONG>Linux executables</STRONG> for Intel-compatible processors,
packaged as Debian packages, or in the Red Hat RPM package system.
It is also easy to prepare your own executables by compiling the
source code on any Linux system that has a C compiler.
</UL>
<P>
Each is available as one or more self-extracting archives.  That means
that they are large files that contain in compressed form the various
executables for that system, plus a self-extraction program.  When you
execute the self-extracting archive as if it were a program, it unpacks
itself into many different files and puts them on your hard disk.
The Mac OS X distribution is as a Disk Image, and after that is unpacked
you have to copy the contents out to another folder before using them.
<P>
If you get the executables for any of these types of machines, make sure
you also get the documentation files.  These are packaged with the
source code in one of the self-extracting archives.
<P>
You will also want to follow the installation instructions, which
you will find <font size=+1><a href="install.html">here</a></font>.
<P>
f you cannot easily configure your system to include them, you should look into
using the For many Unix or Unix-compatible systems, executables are not necessary.
Provided that your Unix system has a C compiler, you can easily
<A HREF="sourcecode.html">compile the source code yourself</A>.
Put the source code in a directory and type "make install",
and executables should be produced.

<H3>Debian linux executables</H3>
<P>
Andreas Tille and Stephane Bortzmeyer have compiled and made available a set of
PHYLIP 3.68 executables for Debian Linux (which includes Ubuntu Linux, which
is a form of Debian Linux).
These are in the "unstable" section of Debian packages
and may be downloaded for free ("free in the sense of free beer") from
<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/phylip">
its page on the Debian web site</A> at
<CODE>http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/phylip</CODE>.
or from various Debian mirror sites.  Of course, one can also install
the source code (see under Unix above) and compile it yourself.
<P>
A similar package is also available from the Bio-Linux distribution at
the NERC Environmental Bioinformatics Centre, Oxford, U.K.  It may be
accessed <a href="http://nebc.nox.ac.uk/tools/bio-linux/package-list">here</a>.
Installation instructions are nearby.

<h3>Executables for FreeBSD</h3>
<P>
A PHYLIP 3.68 package for FreeBSD Unix is available, thanks to David Bader
and others. It is located at
<A HREF="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/biology/phylip/">the BSD PHYLIP package web page</A> at
<code>http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/ports/biology/phylip/</code>.
<P>
<H3>Red Hat Linux RPMs</H3>
<P>
Luc Ducazu, of Merelbeke, Belgium, has put together Red Hat Linux RPM packages
of version 3.61.  There is one of executables compiled with the Gnu GCC
compiler, one of executables compiled with the Intel ICC compiler, and one of
documentation and sources.  They can be downloaded
from <A HREF="http://www.biolinux.org/wiki">the wiki at the Biolinux web site</A>.
This requires a free registration.  These packages have not been updated
in recent years.  They can be installed on versions of Linux that have a
package management system that handles RPMs.  One set is for RedHat 9,
another for the Fedora Core 1 and Fedora Core 2 distributions which are
the successors for the low-end Red Hat distributions, and another is for
Suse Linux 9.1.
