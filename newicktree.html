<H1>The Newick tree format</H1>
<P>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
The Newick Standard for representing trees in computer-readable
form makes use of the correspondence between trees and nested parentheses,
noticed in 1857 by the famous English mathematician
<A HREF="http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Biographies/Cayley.html">Arthur Cayley</A>.  If we have
this rooted tree:
<P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="newicktree.gif" ALT="[Tree of form (B,(A,C,E),D)]">
<P>
then in the tree file it is represented by the following sequence of printable
characters:
<P>
<CODE>(B,(A,C,E),D);</CODE>
<P>
The tree ends with a semicolon.  The bottommost node in this tree is
an interior node, not a tip.  Interior nodes are represented by a pair of
matched parentheses.   Between them are representations of the nodes that are
immediately descended from that node, separated by commas.  In the above tree,
the immediate descendants are B, another interior node, and D.  The other
interior node is represented  by  a  pair  of  parentheses, enclosing
representations of its immediate descendants, A, C, and E.  In our example
these happen to be tips, but in general they could also be interior nodes and
the result would be further nestings of parentheses, to any level.
<P>
Tips are represented by their names.   A name can be any string of
printable characters except blanks, colons, semicolons, parentheses, and square
brackets.
<P>
Because you may want to include a blank in a name, it is assumed that an
underscore character ("_") stands for a blank; any of these in a name will be
converted to a blank when it is read in.  Any name may also be empty: a tree
like
<P>
<CODE>(,(,,),);</CODE>
<P>
is allowed.  Trees can be multifurcating at any level.
<P>
Branch lengths can be incorporated into a tree by putting a real number,
with or without decimal point, after a node and preceded by a colon.  This
represents the length of the branch immediately below that node.   Thus the
above tree might have lengths represented as:
<P>
<CODE>(B:6.0,(A:5.0,C:3.0,E:4.0):5.0,D:11.0);</CODE>
<P>
The tree starts on the first line of the file, and can continue to
subsequent lines.  It is best to proceed to a new line, if at all, immediately
after a comma.  Blanks can be inserted at any point except in the middle of a
species name or a branch length.
<P>
The above description is actually of a subset of the Newick Standard.   For
example, interior nodes can have names in that standard.  These names
follow the right parenthesis for that interior node, as in this example:
<P>
<CODE>(B:6.0,(A:5.0,C:3.0,E:4.0)Ancestor1:5.0,D:11.0);</CODE>
<P>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<P>
To help you understand this tree representation, here are some trees in
the above form:
<P>
<CODE>((raccoon:19.19959,bear:6.80041):0.84600,((sea_lion:11.99700,
seal:12.00300):7.52973,((monkey:100.85930,cat:47.14069):20.59201,
weasel:18.87953):2.09460):3.87382,dog:25.46154);</CODE>
<P>

<CODE>(Bovine:0.69395,(Gibbon:0.36079,(Orang:0.33636,(Gorilla:0.17147,(Chimp:0.19268,
Human:0.11927):0.08386):0.06124):0.15057):0.54939,Mouse:1.21460):0.10;</CODE>
<P>

<CODE>(Bovine:0.69395,(Hylobates:0.36079,(Pongo:0.33636,(G._Gorilla:0.17147,
(P._paniscus:0.19268,H._sapiens:0.11927):0.08386):0.06124):0.15057):0.54939,
Rodent:1.21460);</CODE>
<P>

<CODE>A;</CODE>
<P>

<CODE>((A,B),(C,D));</CODE>
<P>

<CODE>(Alpha,Beta,Gamma,Delta,,Epsilon,,,);</CODE>
<P>
<h2>(Non-)Uniqueness</h2>
<P>
The Newick Standard does not make a unique representation of a tree,
for two reasons.  First, the left-right order of descendants of a node
affects the representation, even though it is biologically uninteresting.
Thus, to a biologist
<P>

<CODE>(A,(B,C),D);</CODE>
<P>

is the same tree as
<P>
<CODE>(A,(C,B),D);</CODE>
<P>
which is in turn the same tree as
<P>
<CODE>(D,(C,B),A);</CODE>
<P>
and that is the same tree as
<P>
<CODE>(D,A,(C,B));</CODE>
<P>
and
<P>
<CODE>((C,B),A,D);</CODE>
<P>
<h2>Rooted and unrooted trees</h2>
<P>
In addition, the standard is representing a rooted tree.  For many
biological purposes we may not be able to infer the position of the
root.  We would like to have a representation of an unrooted tree when
decribing inferences in such cases.  Here the convention is simply to
arbitrarily root the tree and report the resulting rooted tree.  Thus
<P>
<CODE>(B,(A,D),C);</CODE>
<P>
would be the same unrooted tree as
<P>
<CODE>(A,(B,C),D);</CODE>
<P>
and as
<P>
<CODE>((A,D),(C,B));</CODE>
<P>
<h2>Widespread use</h2>
<P>
In spite of this limitation of nonuniqueness the readability of the
resulting representation (for trees of modest size) and the ease of
writing programs that read it have kept this standard in widespread use.
<P>
Its competitors include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_file">NEXUS</a> standard for trees (part of the more
general NEXUS standard for phylogeny data sets).  However the NEXUS
representation of trees is based on the Newick standard -- inside the
NEXUS TREES Block you will find ... Newick trees.
<P>
A less Newick-based standard is the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhyloXML">PhyloXML</a> standard,
which is an XML representation using nesting the &lt;CLADE&gt; ...
&lt;/CLADE&gt; tag pairs instead of parentheses.
<P>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<P>
The Newick Standard was adopted 26 June 1986 by an informal
committee meeting convened by me during the
<a href="http://cms.gogrid.evolutionsociety.org/">Society for the Study of
Evolution</a>
meetings in Durham, New Hampshire and consisting of 
<A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/jarchie3">James Archie</A>,
<a href="http://www.williamday.ca/williamday/Welcome.html">William H.E. Day</a>,
<A HREF="https://waynemaddisonlab.wordpress.com/wayne-maddison/">Wayne Maddison</A>,
<A HREF="http://phylogenomics.berkeley.edu/members/">Christopher Meacham</A>,
<A HREF="http://life.bio.sunysb.edu/ee/rohlf/">F. James Rohlf</A>,
<A HREF="http://fds.duke.edu/db/aas/Biology/faculty/david.swofford">David Swofford</A>, and
<A HREF="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/felsenstein.html">myself</A>.
(The committee was not an activity of the SSE nor endorsed by it).
The reason for the name is that the second and final session of the committee
met at <A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100063654368925">Newick's restaurant</A> in
Dover, New Hampshire, and
we enjoyed the meal of lobsters.  The tree representation was a
generalization of one developed by Christopher Meacham in 1984 for the
tree plotting programs that he wrote for the <a
href="https://phylipweb.github.io/phylip/index.html">PHYLIP</a> package while
visiting Seattle.
His visit was a sabbatical leave from the University of Georgia, which thus
indirectly partly funded that work.
