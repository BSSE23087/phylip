The source code for PHYLIP comes is in the C language.
The programs are written in generic ANSI-compatible
C code which can be compiled on most systems.  There are
conditionally-defined pieces of code to adapt the programs
to Windows, Mac OS or Mac OS X systems, or to Linux or
Unix systems that have X windows.
<P>
Please note that if you simply want to run PHYLIP programs, and you have the
PHYLIP executables, <em>you don't need to compile anything</em>, just use the
executables.

The source code comes with a Makefile that enable it to be compiled easily
on most compilers.
<P>
PHYLIP has been compiled successfully on Unix and Linux systems with the GCC
C compiler, and with proprietary compilers from Sun, HP, Compaq/Digital, SGI,
and many other systems.
<P>
On most Linux or Unix systems all you need to do is type "make install".

Compiling the source code on PCs and on Macs is less easy.  For the most part
you do not have to think about doing it, as we distribute
<A HREF="executables.html">executables</A> for
Windows systems, for Mac OS X systems, and others distribute Linux
executables.
Once in a while
you might want to recompile a program to add a feature of your own; the instructions
for doing this are given in the documentation.  However some leading PC and Mac
compilers do not make this easy.  It is possible to use a
Makefile for the GNU GCC compiler, for
the Microsoft .NET compiler, for Borland C, and for the Cygwin port of GCC to
Windows, but it's harder for Codewarrior C++, which we used to use
for the Mac OS 8 and 9 compiles.  Codewarrior did not use a Makefile, but
requires you
to structure your compilation into "projects".  Unfortunately although many different
compilers do it that way, the project structures differ between
different compilers.  Our distribution supplies
icon files for GCC, MS .NET, Borland C, and Cygwin GCC.
<P>
If you have a PC or a Mac OS X system, try our precompiled executables and
avoid recompiling unless you have to.

<P>
The source code we distribute also has a compile.com file for VMS VAX systems.
The present version should also be able to be compiled on DEC Alpha OpenVMS
systems with a little hand-editing of the <tt>phylip.h</tt> and
<tt>compile.com</tt> files.  We
have not checked this in quite a while, since VMS and OpenVMS systems have
basically disappeared and we have no access to one.
