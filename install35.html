<P>
Let's assume that you have fetched the appropriate executables archive (if any)
for your machine, together with the Documentation and Sources archive.
<P>
These archives are <EM>not</EM> simply a single executable for general
use.  Instead they are a (large) number of files, squished together into
one file, and thus called an "archive".  You have to go through a step
which involves getting all the files out of the archive and into a
directory on your machine.
<P>
We will give these instructions for three
different kinds of systems, Windows, Macintoshes, and Unix systems.

<P>
On a Windows NT, Windows95, or Windows98
system you should have three archive files, called <CODE>phylip.exe</CODE>,
<CODE>phylip95.exe</CODE>, and <CODE>phylip96.exe</CODE>.  These are self-extracting archives,
respectively the Documentation
and Source Code archive and two Executables archives.
<P>
On a Windows 3.1 or Windows 3.0 system you should have four archive
files, called <CODE>phylip.exe, phylipwx.exe, phylipwy.exe,</CODE> and 
<CODE>phylipwz.exe</CODE>.  These are self-extracting archives.
<P>
You should
place them in a directory, which is best called <CODE>C:\PHYLIP</CODE> and
then execute them as programs, one after another.  A self-extracting
archive has a small self-extraction program on its front, and when you
run them as programs they extract themselves and write many files into
your directory.
<P>
You should be able to execute these archives by clicking on their
icons, or by using the Run entry in the Start menu in the lower-left corner
of your screen.
<P>
Or you may want to open an "MSDOS Window" (in Windows95 this is
done using the Programs item on the Start menu which is in the lower-left
corner of your screen).  In the MSDOS window, issue the command <CODE>CD C:\PHYLIP</CODE>
to get to the directory that has the archives.  For Windows95/98/NT, execute
them by issuing the commands:

which run the archives as programs.
<P>
The documentation and source code archive <CODE>phylip.exe</CODE> contains
the six font files <CODE>font1</CODE> through <CODE>font6</CODE>.  So do
the executables archives <CODE>phylip96.exe</CODE> and
<CODE>phylipwz.exe</CODE>.  The self-extraction
code will ask you whether you want to overwrite the copies.  You can safely
answer "Yes" as the two copies of each file are identical.  This is not
an indication of any error or failure of the self-extraction.
<P>
On some Windows systems if you use an MSDOS Window the system will be unable
to run the four archives as programs, claiming it has too little memory. In
this case it may help to exit Windows (using the Start menu) and choose
the option to "Exit to MSDOS".  Then it may have enough memory to carry out
these operations. 
<P>
Once these archives are self-extracted, you will find a file called
<CODE>README.WIN</CODE>.  You should read it, using Windows Notepad, or EDIT, or some
word processor, for further hints on installation.

<P>
The archives for the PowerMac and Macintosh are BinHexed archives.  If you
are fetching the files using a Web browser directly from your Mac, it will
probably automatically invoke Stuffit Expander to unpack the archives into
self-extracting archives.  Self-extracting archives are archives with a small
self-extraction program on their front, so that when they are run as
programs they write a great many files into a folder. 
<P>
If your system does have Stuffit Expander, two self extracting archives will
be created on your desktop, and their file names will have a <CODE>.sea</CODE> in them.  One has the documentation and sources, and the other has the
executables.  When you execute these two <CODE>.sea</CODE> files as programs,
they will open a directory browsing window to allow you to find your way to
the folder where you want to put PHYLIP.  I recommend that you have an empty
folder ready somewhere to put PHYLIP in.  One of the two self-extracting
archives will create two folders, one for the sources and one for the
documentation file. The other will create one folder for the executables.
The main documentation file <CODE>main.doc</CODE>
will also be visible, and a file called <CODE>README</CODE>.  You should
start by reading <CODE>README</CODE>, using SimpleText or some word
processing program.
<P>
If you don't have Stuffit Expander, your web browser will probably
instead leave the files <CODE>phylip.sea.hqx</CODE>
and either <CODE>phylippmac.sea.hqx</CODE> or <CODE>phylipmx.seq.hqx</CODE>
on your desktop.  These have to be extracted using BinHex, or you could
alternatively use our ftp server and use a MacBinary ftp transfer to get
the MacBinary versions of these two archives instead.

The archive for Unix systems is just the Documentation and Sources archive.
You can extract the files from the archive by putting it into a directory
by itself, getting into that directory, and giving the command<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
</DT>
<DD><CODE>uncompress phylip.tar.Z</CODE></DD>
</DL>
This uncompresses the archive so
that it will now be bigger and be called <CODE>phylip.tar</CODE>.  Now it
is a "tar archive".  
<P>
Now just issue the command<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
</DT>
<DD><CODE>tar xvf phylip.tar</CODE></DD>
</DL>
The archive
will be extracted and 93 different files will be written into the current
directory.  These include documentation files (the ones that end in ".doc"),
six font files ("<CODE>font1</CODE>" through "<CODE>font6</CODE>") and a lot of "<CODE>.c</CODE>" and "<CODE>.h</CODE>" files,
plus some Makefiles and a file called <CODE>README</CODE>.  You should read it.
<P>
To make executables, use your C compiler.  You can probably just 
make sure there is a directory "<CODE>bin</CODE>" within your current directory and type
"<CODE>make install</CODE>".  If there are problems, look into changing the <CODE>CFLAGS</CODE> line
and/or the <CODE>CC</CODE> line of the <CODE>Makefile</CODE>.
