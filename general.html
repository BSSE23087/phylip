PHYLIP (the <EM>PHYL</EM>ogeny <EM>I</EM>nference <EM>P</EM>ackage) is a package of programs for inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees).
It is <A HREF="getme-new1.html">available free</A> over the Internet, and written to work on as many
different kinds of computer systems as possible.  The <A HREF="sourcecode.html">source code</A> is
distributed (in C), and executables are also
distributed.  In particular, <A HREF="executables.html">already-compiled executables</A> are available for
Windows (95/98/NT/2000/me/xp/Vista), Mac OS X, and Linux systems.
Older executables are also available for Mac OS 8 or 9 systems.
Complete
documentation is available on documentation files that come with the package.
<P>
<A HREF="programs.html">Methods</A> that are available in the package include parsimony, distance matrix, and
likelihood methods, including bootstrapping and consensus trees.
Data types that can be handled include molecular
sequences, gene frequencies, restriction sites and fragments, distance matrices,
and discrete characters.
<P>
The programs are controlled through a <A HREF="menu.html">menu</A>, which asks the users which
options they want to set, and allows them to start the computation.  The
data are read into the program from a text file, which the user can
prepare using any word processor or text editor (but it is important that
this text file <EM>not</EM> be in the special format of that word processor --
it should instead be in "flat ASCII" or "Text Only" format).  Some
sequence analysis programs such as the ClustalW alignment program can write
data files
in the PHYLIP format.  Most of the programs look for the data in a file called "infile"
-- if they do not find this file they then ask the user to type in the
file name of the data file.
<P>
Output is written onto special files with names like "outfile" and "outtree".
Trees written onto "outtree" are in the <A HREF="newicktree.html">Newick</A> format, an informal standard
agreed to in 1986 by authors of a number of major phylogeny packages.
<P>
At this stage we do not have a mouse-windows interface for PHYLIP.
<P>
PHYLIP is probably the most widely-distributed phylogeny package.  It
is the sixth most frequently cited phylogeny package, after MrBayes, PAUP*,
RAxML, Phyml, and MEGA.
PHYLIP is also the oldest widely-distributed package.  It has been in
distribution since October, 1980, and
has over 30,000 registered users.  It is still being updated.
