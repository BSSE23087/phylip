<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DRAWGRAM.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DRAWGRAM</STRONG>.
Plots rooted phylogenies, cladograms, circular trees and phenograms in a
   wide variety of user-controllable formats.  The program is interactive and
   allows previewing of the tree on PC, Macintosh, or X Windows screens,
   or on Tektronix or Digital graphics terminals.  Final output can be
   to a file formatted for one of the drawing programs, for a ray-tracing or
   VRML browser, or one at can be sent to a laser printer (such as Postscript
   or PCL-compatible printers), on graphics screens or terminals, on pen
   plotters or on dot matrix printers capable of graphics.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DRAWTREE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DRAWTREE</STRONG>.  Similar to DRAWGRAM but plots unrooted phylogenies.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/CONSENSE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CONSENSE</STRONG>.  Computes consensus trees by the majority-rule consensus tree
   method, which also allows one to easily find the strict consensus tree.
   Does NOT compute the Adams consensus tree.  Trees are input in a tree file
   in standard nested-parenthesis notation, which is produced by many of the
   tree estimation programs in the package.
   This program can be used as the final step in doing bootstrap analyses for
   many of the methods in the package.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/TREEDIST.jpg" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>TREEDIST</STRONG>.
Computes the Branch Score distance between trees, which allows for differences in tree topology and which also makes use of branch lengths. Also computes the Robinson-Foulds symmetric difference distance between trees, which allows for differences in tree topology but does not use branch lengths.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/RETREE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>RETREE</STRONG>.
Reads in a tree (with branch lengths if necessary) and allows
   you to reroot the tree, to flip branches, to change species names and
   branch lengths, and then write the result out.  Can be used to convert
   between rooted and unrooted trees, and to write the tree into a
   preliminary version of a new XML tree file format which is under
   development and which is described in the
   <A HREF="doc/retree.html">RETREE documentation web page</A>.
