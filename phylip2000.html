<P>
We have had questions about what would happen to PHYLIP on the
1st of January, 2000.  These questions usually came from
offices set up to shield companies and institutions from any blame for
Year 2000 events.

<P>
We could provide partial assurance.  PHYLIP source code does not, anywhere,
access the system clock or the date.  This was done mostly because there
was not a standard way of doing it, that would work on a wide variety of
different operating systems.  But it has had the happy side effect of making
it more secure against Year 2000 effects.

<P>
We're not aware of any problems having arisen with PHYLIP executables
as a result of the beginning of the Year 2000.
Does this mean that there will be no problem in running PHYLIP due to
the Year 2000?  We're not sure.  The executable you run is produced
by a compiler, and the compiler can and does access the system clock.
Thus it is conceivable that either the compiler you use to compile the
executable, or the compiler we use to compile the executables we
distribute, could get into trouble.
Or, which is more relevant, that the code they produce gets into
trouble.

<P>
But for the moment, we are optimistic, especially as no one has
reported problems.
