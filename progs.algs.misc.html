<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DNA.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DNAINVAR</STRONG>.  For nucleic acid sequence data on four species, computes Lake's and
   Cavender's phylogenetic invariants, which test alternative tree topologies.
   The program also tabulates the frequencies of occurrence of the different
   nucleotide patterns.  Lake's invariants are the method which he calls
   "evolutionary parsimony".

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/CONTRAST.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CONTRAST</STRONG>.
Reads a tree from a tree file, and a data set with continuous
   characters data, and produces the independent contrasts for those
   characters, for use in any multivariate statistics package.  Will also
   produce covariances, regressions and correlations between characters for
   those contrasts.  Can also correct for within-species sampling variation
   when individual phenotypes are available within a population.
