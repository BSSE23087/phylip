<H1> restriction sites data </H1>

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/RESTRICT.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>RESTML</STRONG>.  Estimation of phylogenies by maximum likelihood using restriction
   sites data (not restriction fragments but presence/absence of individual
   sites).  It employs the Jukes-Cantor symmetrical model of nucleotide
   change, which does not allow for differences of rate between transitions
   and transversions.  This program is VERY slow.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/RESTRICT.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>RESTDIST</STRONG>.
Distances calculated from restriction sites data or
   restriction fragments data.  The restriction sites option is the one to
   use to also make distances for RAPDs or AFLPs.  The distances can then
   be used with the <A HREF="progs.data.dist.html">distance matrix programs</A>

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]">(In addition, we can use the <A HREF="progs.data.disc.html">discrete character (0,1) programs</A> to do
parsimony methods on restriction sites.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/BOOT.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>SEQBOOT</STRONG>.
Reads in a data set, and produces multiple data sets from
   it by bootstrap resampling.  Since most programs in the current version of
   the package allow processing of multiple data sets, this can be used
   together with the consensus tree program CONSENSE to do bootstrap (or
   delete-half-jackknife) analyses with most of the methods in this package.
   This program also allows the Archie/Faith technique of permutation of
   species within characters.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/CONSENSE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CONSENSE</STRONG>.  Computes consensus trees by the majority-rule consensus tree
   method, which also allows one to easily find the strict consensus tree.
   Does NOT compute the Adams consensus tree.  Trees are input in a tree file
   in standard nested-parenthesis notation, which is produced by many of the
   tree estimation programs in the package.  This program can be used as the
   final step in doing bootstrap analyses for many of the methods in the
   package.
