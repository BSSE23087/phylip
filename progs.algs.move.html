   Interactive construction of phylogenies from nucleic acid
   sequences, with their evaluation by parsimony and compatibility and the
   display of reconstructed ancestral bases.  This can be used to find
   parsimony or compatibility estimates by hand.
                                                                               
<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>MOVE</STRONG>.
Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete character
   data with two states (0 and 1).  Evaluates parsimony and compatibility
   criteria for those phylogenies and displays reconstructed states throughout
   the tree.  This can be used to find parsimony or compatibility estimates by
   hand.
                                                                               
<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DOLLO.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DOLMOVE</STRONG>.
Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete
   character data with two states (0 and 1) using the Dollo or polymorphism
   parsimony criteria.  Evaluates parsimony and compatibility criteria for
   those phylogenies and displays reconstructed states throughout the tree.
   This can be used to find parsimony or compatibility estimates by hand.
                                                                               
<P> <IMG SRC="icons/RETREE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>RETREE</STRONG>.
Reads in a tree (with branch lengths if necessary) and allows
   you to reroot the tree, to flip branches, to change species names and
   branch lengths, and then write the result out.  Can be used to convert
   between rooted and unrooted trees, and to write the tree into a
   preliminary version of a new XML tree file format which is under
   development and which is described in the
   <A HREF="doc/retree.html">RETREE documentation web page</A>.
