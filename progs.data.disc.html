<H1> Discrete characters </H1>

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>PARS</STRONG>.
Multistate discrete-characters parsimony method.   Up to 8 states
  (as well as "<TT>?</TT>") are allowed.  Cannot do Camin-Sokal or Dollo Parsimony.
  Can cope with multifurcations, reconstruct ancestral states, use character
  weights, and infer branch lengths.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>MIX</STRONG>.
Estimates phylogenies by some parsimony methods for discrete
   character data with two states (0 and 1).  Allows use of the
   Wagner parsimony method, the Camin-Sokal parsimony method, or arbitrary
   mixtures of these.  Also reconstructs ancestral states and allows weighting
   of characters (does not infer branch lengths).

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>MOVE</STRONG>.
Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete character
   data with two states (0 and 1).  Evaluates parsimony and compatibility
   criteria for those phylogenies and displays reconstructed states throughout
   the tree.  This can be used to find parsimony or compatibility estimates by
   hand.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>PENNY</STRONG>.
Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for discrete-character
   data with two states, for the Wagner, Camin-Sokal, and mixed parsimony
   criteria using the branch-and-bound method of exact search.  May be
   impractical (depending on the data) for more than 10-11 species.


<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DOLLO.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DOLLOP</STRONG>.
Estimates phylogenies by the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony
   criteria for discrete character data with two states (0 and 1).  Also
   reconstructs ancestral states and allows weighting of characters.  Dollo
   parsimony is particularly appropriate for restriction sites data; with
   ancestor states specified as unknown it may be appropriate for restriction
   fragments data.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DOLLO.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DOLMOVE</STRONG>.
Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete
   character data with two states (0 and 1) using the Dollo or polymorphism
   parsimony criteria.  Evaluates parsimony and compatibility criteria for
   those phylogenies and displays reconstructed states throughout the tree.
   This can be used to find parsimony or compatibility estimates by hand.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DOLLO.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DOLPENNY</STRONG>.
Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for
    discrete-character data with two states, for the Dollo or polymorphism
   parsimony criteria using the branch-and-bound method of exact search.  May
   be impractical (depending on the data) for more than 10-11 species.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/CLIQUE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CLIQUE</STRONG>.
Finds the largest clique of mutually compatible characters, and
   the phylogeny which they recommend, for discrete character data with two
   states.  The largest clique (or all cliques within a given size range of
   the largest one) are found by a very fast branch and bound search method.
   The method does not allow for missing data.  For such cases the <TT>T</TT>
   (Threshold) option of PARS or MIX may be a useful alternative.
   Compatibility methods are particular useful when some characters are of
   poor quality and the rest of good quality, but when it is not known in
   advance which ones are which.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>FACTOR</STRONG>.
Takes discrete multistate data with character state trees and
   produces the corresponding data set with two states (0 and 1).  Written by
   Christopher Meacham.  This program was formerly used to accomodate
   multistate characters in MIX, but this is less necessary now that PARS is
   available.


<P> <IMG SRC="icons/BOOT.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>SEQBOOT</STRONG>.
Reads in a data set, and produces multiple data sets from
   it by bootstrap resampling.  Since most programs in the current version of
   the package allow processing of multiple data sets, this can be used
   together with the consensus tree program CONSENSE to do bootstrap (or
   delete-half-jackknife) analyses with most of the methods in this package.
   This program also allows the Archie/Faith technique of permutation of
   species within characters.

<P> <IMG SRC="icons/CONSENSE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CONSENSE</STRONG>.
Computes consensus trees by the majority-rule consensus tree
   method, which also allows one to easily find the strict consensus tree.
   Is not able to compute the Adams consensus tree.  Trees are input in a tree
   file in standard nested-parenthesis notation, which is produced by many of
   the tree estimation programs in the package.  This program can be used as
   the final step in doing bootstrap analyses for many of the methods in the
   package.
