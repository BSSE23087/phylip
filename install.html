<P>
Let's assume that you have fetched the appropriate executables archives (if any)
for your machine, together with the Documentation and Sources archive.
<P>
These archives are <EM>not</EM> simply a single executable for general
use.  Instead they are a (large) number of files, squished together into
one file, and thus called an "archive".  You have to go through a step
which involves getting all the files out of the archive and into a
folder on your machine.
<P>
We will give these instructions for four
different kinds of systems, Windows, MacOS, Linux or Unix systems,
Then we will describe how to access the
documentation after installing the package.

When you click to download the Zip archive, most recent Windows systems
will open a window which asks whether you want to open the archive with
Windows Explorer, or want to Save the archive.  Choose to Save it.  It
will be placed in the Downloads folder of your account. There are
now two possibilities:
<P>
<ol>
<li> If it has been extracted, a folder called <tt>phylip-3.698</tt> (one which
does not have the image of a zipper on the folder icon) will also be
there.  Move that folder to where you want it to be. Do not try to
use the programs or documentation while it is still in the Downloads
folder.
<p>
<li>If it has not been extracted, there will be a Zip archive folder (one which
has a zipper on the folder icon). Move it to where you want it to be.
This Zip archive can then be extracted by right-clicking on
its icon and selecting Extract All from the menu that appears.
<p>
It will create a folder called Phylip-3.698.  So if
you place the archive on the Desktop, it will make that folder there.
</ol>
<P>
After the extraction is done, you will find the <TT>phylip-3.698</TT> folder
which has three folders within it, called <TT>doc</TT>, <TT>exe</TT>, and
<TT>src</TT>.  There is also a web page <TT>phylip.html</TT>.  You should
read this in your browser, which you can usually do by clicking on the file.  It contains links to the main documentation
web page <TT>main.html</TT> and to the other documentation pages and
programs.
<P>
<b>Note:</b> There has been a report that on Windows Vista (specifically
the report was for Service Pack 2 on Home Edition) that if you extract the
files into a folder that is somewhere under Program Files, they may not
work properly.   You can avoid this problem if you extract them into a folder
which is somewhere in your own folders.
<P>
<b>What to do if the Avast virus-checking software complains:</b>  We have had
several reports that the Avast virus-checking software will not allow PHYLIP
3.695 to be installed because it concludes that it contains a virus.  It is
complaining about our Java front end for program Drawgram (a file called
DrawGramJava.exe).  We have had this file checked carefully by our
virus-checking company, Sophos, and they find no virus there.  There is the
invocation of a "shell" in that Java code that may alarm Avast, which is being
overcautious.  If you can extract and install the code on someone else's
machine, one which has differemt virus-checking software, you then may be
able to copy the folder over to your machine.
<P>
<b>Issue with Drawgram or Drawtree not finding .dll  libraries.</b>
There has been a report that using Drawgram or Drawtree's Java front-end failed
because a Dynamic Link Library (.dll file) is not found.  This has happened when
people have a 64-bit Windows system but install the 32-bit version of PHYLIP.
There are now both 64- and 32-bit versions of the executables available. If the
problem with finding DLL files persists in spite of you having the correct
version of the Windows executables, try installing the latest version of Java. (Thanks to Isha Androiya).

The archives for Intel iMac are in the Apple
<tt>.dmg</tt> disk image format.
There is one <tt>.dmg</tt> disk image distributed.  It is 12 Megabytes in
size, and is compressed; when uncompressed it is several times larger.
<P>
It contains what looks like a normal folder called <tt>phylip-3.695</tt>, but
<b><em>you should not use the programs while that folder is in the Downloads
folder</em></b>.  It is
<em>important</em> that you use a copy of the contents of the disk image
elsewhere on your system.
Decide where the folder <tt>phylip-3.695</tt> is going to reside, and move
that folder to that new location.  Within it is all the
source code, documentation, and executables. 
</em>
<P>
The executables are 64-bit binaries which will run on
Intel iMacs produced since about 2010.
<P>
<b>Enabling the programs to be run in a Terminal windows by typing their
names:</b>
A set of links can be set up in the <tt>exe</tt> folder to enable you to
run the programs by simply typing their name.  If these are absent,
which they should not be, there is one additional set of steps you need to do:
<OL>
<LI> Open a Terminal window (which you will find in the Utilities folder
of the Applications folder).
<LI> At the prompt, change to the folder where the PHYLIP executables
are kept.  For example, if you have folder <tt>phylip-3.695</tt> on your
desktop, type in the command<BR>
<tt>cd ~/Desktop/phylip-3.695/</tt>
<li> Copy the file <tt>linkmac</tt> from the <tt>src</tt> folder
to this <tt>exe</tt> folder (by giving the command <tt>cp ../src/linkmac
.</tt>)
<LI> Change the permissions of the script <tt>linkmac</tt> to allow it to
execute, by doing the command:<br>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;chmod +x linkmac</TT>
<LI> Then execute the script by typing:
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;./linkmac</TT>
</OL>
The result will be that the executables folder will now have a set of
links, one for each program, that allow the programs to be executed
simply by typing their names.   Thus the programs in that folder can
then be executed either by clicking on their icon, or by typing their
name (in lower case) preceded by <tt>./</tt> to indicate the current
folder, such as <tt>./dnaml</tt>
<P>
This setting up of these links needs to done only once, and they will
be available thereafter.
<P>
<h3>Two problems running our MacOS executables</h3>
<P>
<ol>
<li> <b>The executables permission problem</b>:  The latest Mac OS
operating system versions, since Mountain Lion, will not run executables of PHYLIP
programs when you click in their icons.  It complains that the developer
name is unknown.  This is a security feature.  The problem happens because
when I made the 3.695 executables, I did not sign them with my Apple Developer
identity, so they appear to be from some dangerous person.
<P>
<li><b>The file path problem</b>:  When the programs are run on recent
versions of MacOS (since Catalina, which is MacOS 10.13) the system
may report that it cannot find their default input files "infile" and/or "intree",
or that they need to be told where to write the default output files such as "outfile".
This is due to a change in the default values of the PATH variables.    The
solution will be to use not just the name "infile" but the full file paths such as
<tt>/User/Foobar/phylip/phylip-3.695/exe/infile</tt>
</ol>
To learn how to deal with these problems, look at the detailed instructions in our Bugs documentation page <a
href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/bugs.html"><strong>here</strong></a>,
and while you're at it, enjoy the image of the world's largest terrestrial true bug.

You can easily install
PHYLIP and compile it yourself on a Linux or Unix system,
provided that you have a C compiler
on your system.  (On some Linux systems and in some recent versions of Mac OS
the C compiler is not installed by default, and you may have to
make sure that it is installed).
<P>
The archive for Linux or Unix systems is just the Documentation and Sources archive.
You can extract the files from the archive by putting it into a folder
by itself, getting into that folder, and giving the command<BR>
<DL>
<DT>
</DT>
<DD><CODE>tar -zxvf phylip-3.697.tar.gz</CODE></DD>
</DL>
This uncompresses the archive so
that it will now be bigger and then extracts
the archive.  A <TT>phylip3.697</TT> folder is created that contains
within it three folders, <TT>doc</TT>, <TT>exe</TT>, and <TT>src</TT>, as well
as a web page <TT>phylip.html</TT>.  You should start with that web
page.  It contains links to the documentation web pages, including the main
documentation web page <TT>main.html</TT>.
<P>
To make executables, use your C compiler.  It is probably as simple as
going into the <TT>src</TT> directory, copying <tt>Makefile.unx</tt> and
calling the copy <tt>Makefile</tt>, and then typing the command<br>
<PRE>
    make install
</PRE>
which will cause the programs to be compiled and the executables and font
files installed in
the <TT>exe</TT> directory. Alternatively, you can type the command<br>
<pre>
    make -f Makefile.unx install
</pre>
instead.
<p>
If there are problems with the compilation,
read the relevant sections of <TT>main.html</TT> and also the beginning of the
<TT>Makefile</TT>.
<P>
</ol>
With luck this will work.  After the compilation the executables and their font files
will be in folder <tt>exe</tt>.
<P>
<b>Load Library Path problem</b>. &nbsp;&nbsp;  I have encountered problems with
using the Java interface for the Drawgram and Drawtree programs on
Linux systems.  When running the interface and using its Preview
function to preview the tree, there may be an error message saying
that the program has been unable to find the library file
libdrawgram.so or libdrawtree.so.  These files are present in the
executables folder, but the program still cannot find them
unless the load library path is specified.  This can be done
one of three ways:
<ol>
<li> Before running Drawtree or Drawgram, give a command to
specify the path.  For example, you were user "ernie" and
if the <tt>exe</tt> folder
were the folder <tt>/home/ernie/phylip/phylip-3.697/exe</tt>
you add that to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable with the command
<pre>
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/ernie/phylip/phylip-3.697/exe:$LOAD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>
This has to be done once each session.
<li> Alternatively, you can put that command in the <tt>.bashrc</tt>
or in the <tt>.bash_profile</tt> file in your home directory (folder)
so that it is executed every time you log in.
<li> If you have access to the <tt>/etc</tt> folder on your
system, you could instead put the path <tt>/home/ernie/phylip/phylip-3.697/exe</tt>
in the file <tt>/etc/ld.so.conf</tt> which informs your program where to
search for libraries.
</ol>
These have been problems in recent versions of MacOS.  However, as of MacOS Catalina 10.5.17 these
two problems seem to have gone away.  If you have either for any recent version of MacOS,
do send us an email with details so we can keep the information here current.

<P>
We don't think there are many Mac OS 8 or Mac OS 9 machines around any more
-- Apple long ago abandoned that operating system, and it is probably not
safe to use it on the Internet as it has not been upgraded to cope with
recent security threats.  We no longer distribute Mac OS 8 or 9 executables
for our most recent versions of PHYLIP.  Nevertheless, we do make
available a Stuffit (.sit) archive of executables for PHYLIP 3.65, in the
webpage on Old Versions of PHYLIP, just
in case anyone needs it.
<P>
<P>
<H2>Downloading the single Stuffit archive</H2>
<P>
The archives for Mac OS 8, Mac OS 9 Macintoshes are self-extracting archives.
If you
are fetching the files using a Web browser directly from your Mac, it will
probably automatically invoke Stuffit Expander to unpack the archives into
self-extracting archives.  Self-extracting archives are archives with a small
self-extraction program on their front, so that when they are run as
programs they write a great many files into a folder. 
<P>
Our default distribution is of a single large (4.9 Megabyte) Stuffit
archive called <tt>phylip3.65.sit</tt>.  This should automatically be
unstuffed as it is downloaded.  It contains the source code, documentation,
and Mac OS executables.
<P>
<EM>However, at the moment we have reports of trouble running the unstuffed
archives.  Recent versions of Mac OS 9, and also the Classic environment under
Mac OS, seem to regard the executables files as text files, and they try to
open them under SimpleText, which of course does not work.</EM>
<P>
<H2>Downloading multiple smaller Stuffit archives</H2>
<P>
Some people may wish instead to download these as a series of four
archives.  This might be necessary, for example, if you wanted to
transfer them to a machine that was not connected to the Internet, and needed
them each to be small enough to write onto a floppy disk.
<P>
If you choose to download these instead of the single Stuffit archive,
and our system does automatically invoke Stuffit Expander, four self
extracting archives will
be created on your desktop, and their file names will end in <CODE>.sit</CODE>.
If you have Stuffit Expander, you can use it to expand them.
<P>
Once the archives are downloaded and extracted, they will put
folders on the desktop.  One is called <TT>phylip</TT> and contains
folders <TT>doc</TT> and <TT>src</TT> as well as a web page <TT>phylip.html</TT>.
There are 307 files in all, as these include the documentation files, source
code files, and compilation support files.  You may have to be patient
while the archive is being extracted.
<P>
The three archives of Macintosh Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 executables will create folders <TT>exe</TT>,
<TT>exe.1</TT>, <TT>exe.2</TT> and <TT>exe.3</TT> on the desktop when they are extracted.
For some reason we could not create these inside the <TT>phylip</TT> folder,
but that is where these files need to be put.  Do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Move the <TT>exe</TT> folder inside the <TT>phylip</TT> folder.
<LI>Open the <TT>exe.1</TT> folder, and mark all of its files (you can do this
using the <TT>Select All</TT> menu option in the system <TT>Edit</TT> menu).
<LI>Drag this group of marked files into the <TT>exe</TT> folder which is
now inside the <TT>phylip</TT> folder.
<LI>Now do the same for <TT>exe.2</TT> (mark the files and drag them into
<TT>exe</TT>).
<LI>And do the same for <TT>exe.3</TT> (mark the files and drag them into
<TT>exe</TT>).
<LI> You can now discard the folders <TT>exe.1</TT>, <TT>exe.2</TT> and <TT>exe.3</TT> (if any). If you
have four folders named <TT>phylip3.65.0.sit</TT>, <TT>exe.1.sit</TT>,
<TT>exe.2.sit</TT>, and <TT>exe.3.sit</TT> on your desktop, these can
be discarded too.
<LI>The <TT>phylip3.65</TT> folder can now be moved to wherever you want it to
be.
