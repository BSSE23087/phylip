<P>
Normally, the documentation, source code and executables of PHYLIP are
downloaded using the web page <A HREF="getme.html">Get Me PHYLIP</A>
and the links in it.  If that cannot be done for some reason, one can
also get these materials by using ftp yourself.
<P>
The programs, including executables, source code and documentation, are
available from our server <B>evolution.genetics.washington.edu</B>
in directory <B>pub/phylip</B>.  A set of detailed instructions on how
to get them by anonymous ftp file transfer is available.  You can
display these instructions on your screen now, or transfer them by
ftp as a text file called "Read.Me" which can be read in a word processor
program.

will instead regard it as a request for file transfer, and on some it may
result in nothing at all happening)
