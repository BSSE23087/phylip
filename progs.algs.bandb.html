<H1> Branch-and-bound exact search for best tree </H1>

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/DNA.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DNAPENNY</STRONG>.  Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for nucleic acid sequences
   by branch-and-bound search.  This may not be practical (depending on the
   data) for more than 10 or 11 species.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/DISCRETE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>PENNY</STRONG>.  Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for discrete-character data
   with two states, for the Wagner, Camin-Sokal, and mixed parsimony criteria
   using the branch-and-bound method of exact search.  May be impractical
   (depending on the data) for more than 10-11 species.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/DOLLO.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>DOLPENNY</STRONG>.  Finds all most parsimonious phylogenies for discrete-character data
   with two states, for the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony criteria using the
   branch-and-bound method of exact search.  May be impractical (depending on
   the data) for more than 10-11 species.

<P>
<IMG SRC="icons/CLIQUE.gif" ALT="[Icon]"> <STRONG>CLIQUE</STRONG>.
Finds the largest clique of mutually compatible characters, and
   the phylogeny which they recommend, for discrete character data with two
   states.  The largest clique (or all cliques within a given size range of
   the largest one) are found by a very fast branch and bound search method.
   The method does not allow for missing data.  For such cases the <TT>T</TT>
   (Threshold) option of PARS or MIX may be a useful alternative.
   Compatibility methods are particular useful when some characters are of
   poor quality and the rest of good quality, but when it is not known in
   advance which ones are which.
