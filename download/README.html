<table>
<tr><td>phylip-3.695.exe</td><td>      Self-extracting archive of the Windows
                              executables.  Once you download this, click
                              on this file to extract the contents.   That is,
                              if you can, because security precautions on
                              modern Windows systems may not allow you to
                              download this file, so I have removed it from
                              the files available from our downloads page.</td></tr>

<tr><td>phylip-3.695.zip</td><td>Zip archive of the Windows executables, not
                              self-extracting.  Otherwise the same as the
                              self-extracting verson.</td></tr>

<tr><td width=20%>phylip-3.697.tar.gz</td><td>gzip'ed "tar" archive of
the sources and documentation.</td></tr>

<tr><td>phylip-3.695-osx.dmg</td><td>  Mac OS X "disk image" file.  Make sure that
                              after downloading and mounting these, you
                              copy the contents out into some other folder
                              before you use the programs.</td></tr>

<tr><td>README.html</td><td>                        This explanation.</td></tr>
<tr><td>threshml</td><td> A folder with the provisional (alpha) release of
the program Threshml, which will be distributed with version 3.7a of PHYLIP.
This version has an incomplete documentation HTML file, and is the C code
(including the support files) for a Unix/Linux compile with GCC. For details of
how to compile see the file README.html in that folder.</td></tr>
